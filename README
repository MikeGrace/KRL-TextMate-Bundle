A simple TextMate bundle to help with KRL development

!! Currently this bundle is my JavaScript bundle and will be moved to it's own KRL bundle but I will not be doing that until I get closer to finishing the syntax highlighting portion of the KRL bundle.

Would love any contributions and feedback
